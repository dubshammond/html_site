<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Will. I’m now based in London and studied in Edinburgh. 
      I am soon to start my Master's and have recently been working in global markets intelligence. 
      My goals include learning how to code for data analytics and completing my master's. 
      Outside of work, I’m interested in cricket!</p>
